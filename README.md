This is an extension created with AI to pin windows when right clicking when on the Overview. 
This extension is based on two great existing ones:

https://github.com/arakis/gnome-workspace-overlay
https://github.com/p91paul/middleclickclose.

The first one pin the windows when using a keyboard shortcut.
The second one allows to detect the middle click of the overview.
This extension was not created to study, but just to be used! I used a lot the "pin" feature and I wanted an UI/UX way to do it.
